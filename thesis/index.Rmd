# Abstract {-}

Markov melding is a Bayesian generic approach to combining evidence from multiple sources.
Each evidence source is modelled by separate submodels, which are then joined by a process called melding.
This process, its motivations and inference on the resulting melded model are the primary topics of study in this dissertation.
We discuss one simple example of melding, as well as one more involved example involving the use of computational techniques to perform inference.
