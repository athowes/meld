# Conclusion \label{chapter:conc}

* **Study selection** Throughout this dissertation, as well as @goudie2019joining, it is assumed that the set of studies to be synthesised, and the statistical models used for each study, are prespecified.
In reality this is often not the case. The order of inclusion is important

* **Model misspecification**

* **Scalability**
Multi-stage Metropolis-within-Gibbs operates sequentially: each stage $\ell$ can only be completed after the previous stage $\ell - 1$ has been.
To put it another way, the computational flow is indexed by the chain $\{1, \ldots, M\}$ as in Figure \ref{fig:compflow}.
An alternative, proposed by @lindsten2017divide in a broader SMC context, is to instead utilise divide-and-conquer by operating on a tree $\mathcal{T}$.
Particularly for joining many submodels, this may result in significant computational gains as the resulting algorithm would be more easily parallelisable.
